# Example

This is some example markdown.

It is in here that we will define simple function to 
add two numbers together. This is called `plus`, but it
could also be called `add`, or maybe something more clever:
```js
export function plus(a,b) {
  return a + b
}
```

Just so we know that wasn't a fluke, we'll define a
second function. This time we'll do it in ES6 stabby notation:

```js
export const times = (a,b)  => a * b
```
